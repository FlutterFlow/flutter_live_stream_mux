## Usage

### For deploying Cloud Functions

Create `.env` file in the `functions` directory having the following:

```env
MUX_TOKEN_ID=<mux_token_id>
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=<mux_token_secret>
```

This file can be generated by logging into MUX and generating an API Key (`.env` file can be generated from there).
